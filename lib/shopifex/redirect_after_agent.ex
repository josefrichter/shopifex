defmodule Shopifex.RedirectAfterAgent do
  @moduledoc """
  Caches the post-payment "redirect after" URL keyed by Shopify charge id, so
  `complete_payment/2` can recover it when Shopify redirects the merchant back.

  ## Multi-node deploys: use `Shopifex.RedirectAfter.Ecto`

  This default implementation is an in-memory `Agent` local to **one node**. A
  charge confirmation can redirect to `/payment/complete` on a *different* node
  than the one that handled `select_plan` (e.g. behind a load balancer / on a
  multi-node deploy like Fly.io), in which case the lookup misses and the grant
  is not created. It is intermittent and won't show up in single-node dev.

  If you run more than one node, configure the shipped, multi-node-safe
  `Shopifex.RedirectAfter.Ecto` (a DB-backed table) instead:

      config :shopifex, :redirect_after_agent, Shopifex.RedirectAfter.Ecto

  `mix shopifex.install` generates that config and the backing migration for new
  apps. Any module implementing this behaviour works — the config seam is just
  `Application.get_env(:shopifex, :redirect_after_agent, __MODULE__)`.

  When a lookup misses, `complete_payment/2` no longer fails silently: it logs an
  actionable `Logger.error` (the usual cause is this node-local cache on a
  multi-node deploy), so dropped grants are observable rather than invisible.

  `set/2` and `get/1` agree on key type: both coerce a binary charge id to an
  integer (matching the integer `grants.charge_id` column), so the string id that
  `PaymentController` produces from a Shopify GID round-trips correctly.
