defmodule Shopifex.Plug.LoadProxyShop do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves the shop from a verified Shopify app-proxy request and makes it
  available via `Shopifex.Plug.current_shop/1`.

  App-proxy requests carry a signed `shop` param, but `Shopifex.Plug.ValidateHmac`
  only verifies the signature — it does not load the shop. Run this plug **after**
  `ValidateHmac` (the default `:shopify_proxy` pipeline does) so proxy controllers
  can use `Shopifex.Plug.current_shop(conn)`.

  The `shop` param is part of the signed payload, so by the time this plug runs
  `ValidateHmac` has already authenticated it.

  ## Options

    * `:on_missing` — what to do when the signed `shop` is absent or not found in
      the database:
      * `:pass` (default) — continue with `current_shop/1` returning `nil`, so
        existing proxy endpoints that don't need the shop are unaffected.
      * `:halt` — respond `401` and halt.

  ## Example

      pipeline :strict_proxy do
        plug :fetch_session
        plug Shopifex.Plug.FetchFlash
        plug Shopifex.Plug.ValidateHmac
        plug Shopifex.Plug.LoadProxyShop, on_missing: :halt
      end
