defmodule Shopifex.Auth do
  @moduledoc """
  Shopify access-token lifecycle for background / non-embedded paths.

  ## Why this module exists

  Shopify expiring offline access tokens have a 1-hour TTL. The embedded
  flow refreshes them via `Shopifex.Plug.ManagedInstall` (id_token →
  access_token exchange on every page load past a threshold). But
  background paths — schedulers, webhook handlers — don't have an
  id_token. They refresh independently using the stored `refresh_token`
  (90-day TTL, one-time use).

  This module is that refresh path. It is the background-equivalent of the
  embedded re-exchange, and `Shopifex.API.graphql/3` calls into it both
  proactively (before a request) and reactively (after a 401).

  ## Shopify's recommended strategy

  > "Proactively refresh tokens a few minutes before they expire, and
  > when you receive a 401 response."
  > -- https://shopify.dev/changelog/offline-access-tokens-now-support-expiry-and-refresh

  - **Proactive:** `ensure_fresh_token/1` checks `token_expires_at` and
    refreshes if it's within the safety window (5 minutes).
  - **Reactive:** `Shopifex.API.graphql/3` catches 401 responses and calls
    `refresh!/1` once before retrying.

  ## Concurrency

  Refresh tokens are one-time use — using a refresh_token invalidates it
  immediately and the response includes a fresh refresh_token to use next
  time. If two callers refresh in parallel, the second one will get
  `invalid_grant` from Shopify and clobber the new refresh_token.

  To prevent that, `refresh!/1` acquires a cross-node lease in the dedicated
  `shopifex_token_refresh_leases` table. The Shopify request runs without a
  transaction or lock on the consumer's shop row. After Shopify responds, a
  short transaction locks and re-checks the shop before persisting, so a
  concurrent managed-install exchange is never overwritten.

  ## Caveats

  - **Legacy installs have `refresh_token = nil`** — they were installed
    with the non-expiring offline token flow. For these shops,
    `ensure_fresh_token/1` and `refresh!/1` are no-ops (there is no
    refresh_token to spend), and the non-expiring access token keeps working
    for API calls. Such a shop is **not** upgraded automatically: opening the
    embedded app does not re-exchange it, because `Shopifex.Plug.ManagedInstall`
    treats a `nil` `token_expires_at` as fresh (its `token_stale?` guard returns
    false for a nil expiry). The exception is a stored `scope` that lacks a
    configured scope, which does trigger a re-exchange. To move a legacy shop
    onto expiring tokens, back-fill it with `migrate_to_expiring_token/1` (see
    that function's docs) or have the merchant reinstall the app.

  - **If the refresh_token itself expires** (after 90 days of no refresh),
    Shopify returns 400 with `invalid_grant`. `refresh!/1` returns
    `{:error, ...}`. The next embedded page load fixes it via fresh token
    exchange.

  ## Configuration

  Uses the existing Shopifex configuration:

      config :shopifex,
        api_key: "your_api_key",
        secret: "your_api_secret"

  Tests can inject Req options (e.g. a `Req.Test` plug) via:

      config :shopifex, :req_options, plug: {Req.Test, Shopifex.ReqStub}

  Refresh coordination can be tuned when necessary:

      config :shopifex,
        token_refresh_lease_ttl_ms: 120_000,
        token_refresh_wait_timeout_ms: 15_000,
        token_refresh_poll_interval_ms: 100

  Strategy:
  - Token expiry is unknown (`nil`) → `{:ok, shop}` as-is. The caller is
    responsible for invoking `refresh!/1` reactively on 401. This covers
    legacy shops that pre-date the expiry columns.
  - Token expires within the safety window → refresh and return
    `refresh!/1`'s result.
  - Otherwise → `{:ok, shop}` as-is.

  refresh error shouldn't crash the caller. `Shopifex.API.graphql/3` reacts
  to a stale token via its 401 retry. Callers that need to distinguish
  success from failure (or terminal from transient errors) should call

  rejects the refresh (most commonly `invalid_grant` when the refresh_token

  Exchange a legacy **non-expiring** offline access token for an expiring one
  plus a refresh token.

  This is the in-place way for a shop installed before expiring offline tokens
  existed to acquire a `refresh_token`. Until it runs (or the merchant
  reinstalls the app), `refresh!/1` returns `{:error, :no_refresh_token}` for
  that shop. Re-opening the embedded app does **not** upgrade it:
  `Shopifex.Plug.ManagedInstall` treats a `nil` `token_expires_at` as fresh (its
  `token_stale?` guard returns false for a nil expiry) and re-exchanges only
  when the stored `scope` lacks a configured scope.

  > #### Irreversible {: .warning}
  >
  > Shopify destroys the non-expiring token in the same transaction that issues
  > the expiring pair. The call must never be retried — if the response is lost,
  > that shop has no usable token until a merchant reinstalls. The request pins
  > `retry: false` even when the host app configured retries globally.

  Expiring offline access tokens are required for public apps' GraphQL Admin API
  requests as of 2027-01-01.

  ## Back-filling an install base

  Idempotence lives in the *selection*, not the call — a shop that already has a
  `token_expires_at` has been migrated:

      import Ecto.Query

      MyApp.Repo.all(from s in MyApp.Shop, where: is_nil(s.token_expires_at))
      |> Enum.each(fn shop ->
        case Shopifex.Auth.migrate_to_expiring_token(shop) do
          {:ok, _migrated} -> :ok
          {:error, reason} -> MyApp.report_migration_failure(shop, reason)
        end
      end)

  Returns `{:ok, shop}`, or:

    * `{:error, :already_expiring}` — the shop already has a `token_expires_at`
    * `{:error, :no_access_token}` — nothing to exchange
    * `{:error, :shop_not_found}` — the row vanished between call and persist
    * `{:error, {:migrate_failed, status, body}}` — Shopify rejected the exchange
    * `{:error, {:migrate_request_failed, exception}}` — transport failure; the
      token may or may not have been cycled, so treat the shop as needing manual
      inspection rather than re-running this function
    * `{:error, {:persist_failed, changeset, attrs}}` — Shopify cycled the token
      but the database write failed. `attrs` carries the new token material so
      the caller can recover the shop; it is deliberately **not** logged.
