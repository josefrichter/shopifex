defmodule Shopifex.ManagedInstall.Callbacks do
  @moduledoc """
  Extensibility hooks for the managed-installation flow
  (`Shopifex.Plug.ManagedInstall`).

  Managed installation runs inside a plug, *before* any controller, so it cannot
  use `ShopifexWeb.AuthController`'s `insert_shop/1` and `after_install/3`
  callbacks (those only apply to the legacy OAuth controller flow). Instead,
  configure a callback module here to customise how a newly token-exchanged shop
  is persisted and what side effects run on first install:

      config :shopifex,
        managed_install_callbacks: MyApp.ManagedInstallCallbacks

      defmodule MyApp.ManagedInstallCallbacks do
        use Shopifex.ManagedInstall.Callbacks

        @impl true
        def insert_shop(attrs) do
          # enforce single-tenant, attach defaults, etc.
          Shopifex.Shops.create_shop(attrs)
        end

        @impl true
        def after_install(shop) do
          # fetch shop profile, send yourself an email, take a baseline snapshot…
          :ok
        end
      end

  All callbacks are optional — `use Shopifex.ManagedInstall.Callbacks` provides
  defaults (`insert_shop/1` delegates to `Shopifex.Shops.create_shop/1`,
  `after_install/1` and `after_exchange/2` are no-ops). The plug always configures
  webhooks itself (first install and on every re-exchange), regardless of the hooks.

  ## When each hook runs

  | Hook                | First install | Token re-exchange (refresh) |
  |---------------------|:-------------:|:---------------------------:|
  | `insert_shop/1`     | ✅            | — (uses `update_shop/2`)    |
  | `after_install/1`   | ✅            | —                           |
  | `after_exchange/2`  | ✅            | ✅                          |

  Use `after_exchange/2` for side effects that must run on refreshes too (it
  receives `new?`); use `after_install/1` for one-time install work.

  > **Callbacks run synchronously inside the plug**, in the merchant's request.
  > Anything slow (a profile fetch, snapshot, external sync) will block the page
  > load — spawn your own supervised `Task` for it. The library does not wrap
  > callbacks in a Task.

  re-sync external state), where `after_install/1` would only fire once.
